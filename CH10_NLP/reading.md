## Overview

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. 
- NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. 
- It involves a range of tasks and techniques to work with text and speech data, making it a fundamental part of many AI applications.

1. **Text Processing:** NLP begins with basic text processing tasks like tokenization (breaking text into words or sentences), stemming (reducing words to their base form), and lemmatization (reducing words to their dictionary form). These processes help prepare text for analysis.

2. **Text Classification:** NLP can be used for text classification tasks, where text data is categorized into predefined classes or labels. Common applications include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** NER identifies and categorizes named entities in text, such as names of people, places, organizations, and dates. It is valuable for information extraction and content analysis.

4. **Sentiment Analysis:** This task determines the sentiment or emotion expressed in text, typically as positive, negative, or neutral. Businesses often use sentiment analysis to gauge customer feedback.

5. **Machine Translation:** Machine translation systems like Google Translate use NLP to automatically translate text from one language to another. This involves complex tasks like language modeling and statistical machine translation.

6. **Text Generation:** NLP models, including neural networks like GPT-3, are capable of generating human-like text. This can be used for chatbots, content creation, and even creative writing.

7. **Question Answering:** NLP models can answer questions based on textual information. This is used in virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa and is also relevant in search engines.

8. **Information Retrieval:** Information retrieval systems help users find relevant documents or web pages based on their queries. Search engines are a classic example.

9. **Language Models:** Large pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT, have revolutionized NLP. They can perform a wide range of tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

10. **Speech Recognition:** NLP extends to speech data as well. Speech recognition technology, like that used in virtual assistants, converts spoken language into text.

11. **Language Understanding:** Understanding context, idiomatic expressions, and figurative language is a complex aspect of NLP. This is crucial for human-like communication.

12. **Text Summarization:** NLP can automatically generate summaries of long texts or documents, making it easier to extract key information.

13. **Contextual Analysis:** Analyzing text within its context is a significant challenge. Understanding nuances, sarcasm, and cultural references requires advanced NLP models.

14. **Privacy and Ethical Considerations:** With the vast amount of textual data available, NLP also encompasses ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and issues related to bias in AI systems.

15. **NLP Libraries and Tools:** NLP practitioners use various libraries and tools, including NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (for deep learning-based models), and more.

## tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization

- Fundamental text processing techniques used in natural language processing (NLP) to prepare text data for analysis.

1. **Tokenization**:
   - **Definition**: Tokenization is the process of breaking a text into individual words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements, known as tokens.
   - **Purpose**: Tokenization simplifies text analysis by dividing text into smaller units. It is a crucial initial step for most NLP tasks.
   - **Token Examples**:
     - Sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
     - Tokens: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog", "."]

2. **Stemming**:
   - **Definition**: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their base or root form by removing suffixes. It doesn't always result in a real word but aims to remove variations and simplify words to a common form.
   - **Purpose**: Stemming reduces words to their core form, which helps in information retrieval and text analysis, such as word frequency analysis.
   - **Stemming Examples**:
     - Original Word: "jumps"
     - Stem: "jump"
     - Original Word: "running"
     - Stem: "run"
   - **Stemmers**: There are various stemming algorithms and libraries, such as the Porter stemmer and Snowball stemmer.

3. **Lemmatization**:
   - **Definition**: Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base form or dictionary form (known as the lemma). Unlike stemming, lemmatization produces valid words.
   - **Purpose**: Lemmatization is more linguistically accurate than stemming and is useful for tasks where the meaning of words is critical, such as sentiment analysis or machine translation.
   - **Lemmatization Examples**:
     - Original Word: "jumps"
     - Lemma: "jump"
     - Original Word: "running"
     - Lemma: "run"
   - **Lemmatizers**: NLP libraries like spaCy and NLTK offer lemmatization capabilities.

**Key Differences**:
- Stemming is faster and simpler, but it may not always result in valid words. Lemmatization is more accurate but computationally intensive.
- Stemming chops off suffixes to get to the root form, while lemmatization considers the meaning of the word in the context of a language and produces valid words.
- Stemming may result in words that are not actual words but are related to the base form, whereas lemmatization ensures that the resulting word is a valid lemma in the language.

## how to build a Bag of Words model

### What is a Bag of Words model?

- A fundamental technique in natural language processing (NLP) for text analysis. 
- It represents text data as a collection of individual words, ignoring the order and structure of the words in the text. 
- The primary concept behind the BoW model is to convert text data into a numerical format that can be used for various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.

1. **Tokenization**: The text data is first tokenized, meaning it's split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation, numbers, and other non-alphabet characters are typically removed, and words are converted to lowercase for consistency.

2. **Vocabulary Creation**: A vocabulary or dictionary is created, consisting of all unique words present in the text corpus. Each word is assigned a unique index or identifier. The vocabulary is constructed based on the entire dataset or a specific document collection.

3. **Vectorization**: Each document (piece of text) is represented as a numerical vector. The length of the vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary. The values in the vector represent word frequencies, typically using one of these approaches:
   - **Binary Encoding**: The presence or absence of each word in the document is represented as 1 or 0, respectively.
   - **Word Count**: The frequency of each word in the document.
   - **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: A more advanced approach that takes into account the importance of a word not just within a document but also across the entire corpus.

4. **Sparse Matrix**: The resulting vectors are typically high-dimensional and sparse because most documents contain only a small subset of the entire vocabulary. Sparse matrices are used to store this data efficiently.

The Bag of Words model is widely used in various NLP applications, such as text classification, spam detection, and information retrieval. It's a simple and effective way to represent text data, but it has some limitations:
- It doesn't consider the order of words in the text, which can result in a loss of context and semantic information.
- It treats each word independently, ignoring the relationships and dependencies between words.
- It can lead to high-dimensional data representations, especially in large vocabularies.

### How to build a Bag of Words model in Python

- Including text preprocessing, vocabulary creation, and document vectorization.

**Step 1: Install NLTK and Download Necessary Resources**

If you haven't already, you need to install NLTK and download required resources. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

Once NLTK is installed, you can download the punkt tokenizer models, which are necessary for tokenization:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("punkt")
```

**Step 2: Import Libraries**

Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from collections import Counter
```

**Step 3: Preprocess the Text**

Prepare the text data you want to convert into a BoW model. For example:

```python
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog barks loudly."
```

**Step 4: Tokenization**

Tokenize the text, splitting it into individual words:

```python
words = word_tokenize(text)
```

**Step 5: Create the Vocabulary**

Create a vocabulary by counting unique words in the text. You can use the `Counter` object to do this:

```python
vocabulary = Counter(words)
```

**Step 6: Represent the Documents**

To represent documents as BoW vectors, you can use the vocabulary created in the previous step. You'll create a dictionary where the keys are words, and the values are the corresponding word frequencies. Here's an example:

```python
document = "The quick dog barks"
document_words = word_tokenize(document)

document_vector = {word: document_words.count(word) for word in vocabulary}
```

Now, `document_vector` is a BoW representation of the document "The quick dog barks." The keys in the dictionary are words from the vocabulary, and the values are the word frequencies in the document.

**Step 7: Repeat for Multiple Documents**

If you have multiple documents you want to represent using the BoW model, repeat the process for each document. You can create a matrix where each row represents a document and each column represents a word from the vocabulary.

The resulting matrix can be used for various NLP tasks, such as text classification or sentiment analysis.

## how to use machine learning to analyze the sentiment of a given sentence.

- Analyzing the sentiment of a given sentence using machine learning involves training a model to **classify** the **sentiment of text data into categories** like **positive, negative, or neutral**.

**Step 1: Data Collection**
Collect a labeled dataset that contains sentences or texts along with their corresponding sentiment labels. Each text should be labeled as either positive, negative, or neutral. You can use existing sentiment datasets or create your own by manually labeling the data.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
Preprocess the text data to make it suitable for machine learning. Common preprocessing steps include:
- Tokenization: Splitting the text into words or tokens.
- Removing punctuation and special characters.
- Lowercasing: Converting all words to lowercase to ensure consistency.
- Removing stopwords: Common words that do not contribute much to sentiment analysis.

**Step 3: Feature Extraction**
Transform the preprocessed text data into numerical features that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. The most common approach is to use Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

**Step 4: Model Selection**
Choose a machine learning model for sentiment classification. Common choices include:
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable model often used for text classification tasks.
- **Naive Bayes**: Particularly suited for text classification tasks and works well with text data.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Can be effective for text classification with appropriate kernel functions.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be used for more complex sentiment analysis tasks. You can use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.

**Step 5: Model Training**
Split your labeled dataset into a training set and a validation/test set. Use the training set to train your sentiment classification model.

**Step 6: Model Evaluation**
Evaluate the performance of your model using the validation or test set. Common evaluation metrics for sentiment analysis include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can use scikit-learn for model evaluation.

**Step 7: Model Deployment**
Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, you can deploy it for sentiment analysis of new, unseen sentences. You can create a user interface or API to accept sentences and provide sentiment labels.

**Step 8: Continuous Improvement**
Monitor your model's performance in a production environment and consider retraining it with new data periodically to improve its accuracy.

Here's a simplified example of sentiment analysis using scikit-learn and a logistic regression model:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Prepare your labeled dataset
sentences = ["I love this product.", "This is terrible.", "It's okay.", ...]
labels = ["positive", "negative", "neutral", ...]

# Step 2: Preprocess the text (tokenization, lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.)

# Step 3: Feature extraction (TF-IDF vectorization)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences)

# Step 4: Model selection and training
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 7: Deploy the model for sentiment analysis of new sentences
```

## topic modeling and implement a system to identify topics in a given document.

- Topic modeling is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to discover the **underlying topics** within a collection of documents. 
- One common method for topic modeling is **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**.

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Collect a dataset of documents. This dataset should contain text documents related to various topics.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
- Preprocess the text data by performing tasks like tokenization, lowercasing, and stop word removal.
- Create a document-term matrix (DTM) or a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix, where rows represent documents, and columns represent terms (words).
- Prepare the data for topic modeling.

**Step 3: Train the LDA Model**
- Choose the number of topics (K) you want the model to discover. This may require experimentation and domain knowledge.
- Train an LDA model using a library like Gensim or scikit-learn. Specify the number of topics (K) as a hyperparameter.
- Adjust other hyperparameters like alpha and beta, which control the prior distribution over topics and words. These hyperparameters influence the model's behavior.

**Step 4: Extract Topics**
- After training, you can extract the topics. Each topic is represented as a distribution over terms (words).
- You can inspect the top N terms for each topic to understand what each topic represents. This step requires domain knowledge to label the topics based on the most common terms.

**Step 5: Topic Assignment**
- Given a new document, you can use the trained LDA model to assign topics to it.
- The model will provide a probability distribution over topics for the document, indicating the likelihood of the document belonging to each topic.

**Step 6: Implement the System**
- To implement a system for topic identification in a given document, you need to integrate the trained LDA model.
- Preprocess the new document in the same way as your training data (tokenization, lowercasing, etc.).
- Use the LDA model to assign topics to the document.
- The topics with the highest probabilities are the most likely topics for the document.

```python
import gensim
from gensim import corpora
from gensim.models import LdaModel

# Step 1: Prepare your dataset (a list of documents)
documents = ["Document 1 text", "Document 2 text", ...]

# Step 2: Preprocess the data and create a document-term matrix
texts = [document.split() for document in documents]
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]

# Step 3: Train the LDA model
num_topics = 5  # You can choose the number of topics
lda_model = LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary)

# Step 4: Extract and interpret topics
topics = lda_model.print_topics(num_words=10)  # Top 10 terms for each topic

# Step 5: Topic assignment for a new document
new_document = "New document text"
new_text = new_document.split()
new_bow = dictionary.doc2bow(new_text)
topics = lda_model.get_document_topics(new_bow)

# Step 6: Implement your topic identification system
# Select the topic with the highest probability for the new document
best_topic = max(topics, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(f"Most likely topic: Topic {best_topic[0]}")
```

## Tokenizing

### Definition

- The process of dividing a text or document into individual units, typically words or phrases, known as tokens. 
- These tokens serve as the building blocks for text analysis in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics. 
- Tokenization is a crucial step in preparing text data for various NLP tasks, as it breaks down the text into manageable and meaningful components.

1. **Tokens**: Tokens are the individual units created during tokenization. They can be words, subwords, or even characters, depending on the chosen tokenization strategy. For most NLP tasks, words are the primary focus.

2. **Words vs. Phrases**: Tokenization can be as simple as splitting text into words, which is often the case. However, in some contexts, tokenization may include splitting text into phrases, such as n-grams (combinations of n words) or subword units. This flexibility allows for various levels of granularity in text representation.

3. **Punctuation and Special Characters**: Tokenization typically involves removing or handling punctuation and special characters in the text. For example, "it's" might be tokenized as "it" and "'s."

4. **Case Sensitivity**: Tokenization can be case-sensitive (e.g., treating "Apple" and "apple" as different tokens) or case-insensitive (treating them as the same token).

5. **Stopwords**: Common words like "and," "the," and "in" are known as stopwords and are often excluded from tokenization to focus on more meaningful content words.

6. **Languages**: Tokenization methods may vary depending on the language of the text. For example, English tokenization may differ from tokenization in Chinese or Arabic due to differences in word boundaries and script.

7. **Tokenization Libraries**: Tokenization can be performed using NLP libraries and tools like NLTK, spaCy, and regular expressions. These libraries offer various tokenization methods and functionalities.

8. **Applications**: Tokenization is used in a wide range of NLP applications, including text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, information retrieval, and more.

Here's a simple example of tokenizing a sentence using Python and the NLTK library:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

sentence = "Tokenization is an important step in natural language processing."
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
print(tokens)
```

The output will be a list of tokens: `['Tokenization', 'is', 'an', 'important', 'step', 'in', 'natural', 'language', 'processing', '.']`

### Examples
- A fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP).

**Using NLTK**:
NLTK offers a simple way to tokenize text into words or sentences. You'll need to install NLTK and download any required resources or corpora before using it.

```python
# Install NLTK and download resources (if not already installed)
# import nltk
# nltk.download('punkt')

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Tokenization is the process of dividing text into words or sentences. It's a fundamental step in NLP."

# Tokenize into words
words = word_tokenize(text)
print("NLTK Word Tokens:", words)

# Tokenize into sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
print("NLTK Sentence Tokens:", sentences)
```

**Using spaCy**:
spaCy is known for its speed and efficiency. It also provides easy access to part-of-speech tags and other linguistic features.

```python
# Install spaCy and download a language model (if not already installed)
# !pip install spacy
# !python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

import spacy

# Load the English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

text = "Tokenization is the process of dividing text into words or sentences. It's a fundamental step in NLP."

# Process the text with spaCy
doc = nlp(text)

# Tokenize into words
words = [token.text for token in doc]
print("spaCy Word Tokens:", words)

# Tokenize into sentences
sentences = [sent.text for sent in doc.sents]
print("spaCy Sentence Tokens:", sentences)
```

## Converting words to their base forms using stemming

- Stemming is a **text normalization technique** in natural language processing (NLP) that **reduces words to their root or base forms**. 
- It's used to **simplify text data by removing common prefixes or suffixes** from words. The goal of stemming is to **treat words with similar meanings** as if they were the same word.
- A popular stemming algorithm is the **Porter stemming algorithm**.

**Step 1: Import NLTK and the Stemming Module**

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
```

**Step 2: Initialize the Stemmer**

Create an instance of the PorterStemmer:

```python
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
```

**Step 3: Perform Stemming**

You can now use the stemmer to convert words to their base forms:

```python
word = "running"
stemmed_word = stemmer.stem(word)
print("Original word:", word)
print("Stemmed word:", stemmed_word)
```

In this example, the word "running" is stemmed to its base form "run."

```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

# Initialize the stemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()

# Example words
words = ["running", "flies", "happily", "jumps"]

# Stem the words
stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]

# Print the results
for i in range(len(words)):
    print(f"Original word: {words[i]}\tStemmed word: {stemmed_words[i]}")
```

## Converting words to their base forms using lemmatization

Lemmatization is a text normalization technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to reduce words to their base or dictionary forms, known as lemmas. Unlike stemming, which involves removing prefixes and suffixes to approximate the base form of a word, lemmatization takes into account the word's meaning and context to produce more accurate results.

To perform lemmatization in Python, you can use the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which provides lemmatization tools. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to convert words to their base forms using lemmatization:

**Step 1: Initialize the Lemmatizer**

Create an instance of the WordNetLemmatizer, which is a lemmatization tool provided by NLTK:

```python
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
```

**Step 2: Perform Lemmatization**

You can now use the lemmatizer to convert words to their base forms. Specify the part of speech (POS) tag if necessary (e.g., "n" for noun, "v" for verb).

Here's an example of lemmatizing words as verbs:

```python
word = "running"
lemma = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos="v")
print("Original word:", word)
print("Lemma:", lemma)
```

In this example, the word "running" is lemmatized as "run" when specifying the part of speech as a verb (pos="v").

**Step 3: Lemmatize a List of Words**

You can lemmatize a list of words as follows:

```python
words = ["running", "flies", "happily", "jumps"]
lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos="v") for word in words]  # Lemmatize as verbs
```

The lemmatized list, `lemmas`, will contain the base forms of the words as verbs.

Here's a complete code example:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Initialize the lemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

# Example words
words = ["running", "flies", "happily", "jumps"]

# Lemmatize the words as verbs
lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos="v") for word in words]

# Print the results
for i in range(len(words)):
    print(f"Original word: {words[i]}\tLemma: {lemmas[i]}")
```

## Dividing text data into chunks

Dividing text data into smaller, more manageable parts or "chunks" is a common preprocessing step in natural language processing (NLP). This process can make it easier to analyze and process large textual datasets. Several techniques can be used for dividing text data into chunks:

1. **Sentence Tokenization:**
   - **Description:** Divide a text into sentences.
   - **Library:** You can use NLTK, spaCy, or other NLP libraries.
   - **Example (with NLTK):**
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('punkt')  # Download the necessary data
     from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

     text = "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence."
     sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
     ```

2. **Word Tokenization:**
   - **Description:** Divide a sentence into individual words or tokens.
   - **Library:** NLTK, spaCy, and other NLP libraries provide tokenization functions.
   - **Example (with NLTK):**
     ```python
     from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

     sentence = "Tokenize this sentence."
     words = word_tokenize(sentence)
     ```

3. **Custom Chunking:**
   - **Description:** Define specific patterns or rules to extract chunks of text, such as extracting noun phrases or named entities.
   - **Library:** spaCy and NLTK allow you to define custom rules.
   - **Example (with spaCy for named entities):**
     ```python
     import spacy

     nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
     text = "Apple Inc. is a company based in Cupertino, California."
     doc = nlp(text)

     for entity in doc.ents:
         print(entity.text, entity.label_)
     ```

4. **n-grams:**
   - **Description:** Divide text into contiguous sequences of n words.
   - **Library:** You can use NLTK or custom code for n-gram extraction.
   - **Example (with NLTK for bigrams):**
     ```python
     from nltk.util import ngrams

     text = "This is an example sentence for bigram generation."
     words = word_tokenize(text)
     bigrams = list(ngrams(words, 2))
     ```

5. **Fixed-Length Chunks:**
   - **Description:** Split text into fixed-length chunks of a certain number of characters or words.
   - **Custom Code:** You can use Python's string manipulation functions.
   - **Example (splitting into chunks of 100 characters):**
     ```python
     text = "This is a long text that needs to be split into fixed-length chunks."
     chunk_size = 100
     chunks = [text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]
     ```

6. **Paragraph Splitting:**
   - **Description:** Split the text into paragraphs or sections, typically separated by empty lines.
   - **Custom Code:** Use regular expressions to detect paragraph boundaries.
   - **Example (with regex):**
     ```python
     import re

     text = "First paragraph.\n\nSecond paragraph.\n\nThird paragraph."
     paragraphs = re.split(r'\n\s*\n', text)
     ```

## Extracting document term matrix using the Bag of Words model

To create a Document-Term Matrix (DTM) using the Bag of Words (BoW) model, you can follow these steps. In this example, I'll use Python and the `CountVectorizer` class from scikit-learn, which simplifies the process of creating a DTM.

**Step 1: Import Libraries**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
```

**Step 2: Prepare Your Text Data**

Prepare a list of text documents. For example:

```python
documents = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?",
]
```

**Step 3: Create the Document-Term Matrix (DTM)**

Instantiate the `CountVectorizer` and fit it on your documents:

```python
# Create the CountVectorizer object
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the documents into a document-term matrix
dtm = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
```

In this step, `fit_transform` converts your text data into a sparse matrix where rows represent documents and columns represent unique words (terms). The values in the matrix represent the frequency of each term in the corresponding document.

**Step 4: Explore the DTM**

You can explore the DTM as follows:

```python
# Get the feature names (words)
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

# Convert the DTM to a dense matrix for easier exploration (not recommended for large datasets)
dense_dtm = dtm.toarray()

# Print the DTM
print("Document-Term Matrix:")
print(dense_dtm)

# Print feature names
print("Feature Names (Words):")
print(feature_names)
```

In this example, `dense_dtm` is a dense matrix representation of the DTM. Note that for large datasets, using a sparse matrix (as obtained from `fit_transform`) is more memory-efficient.

The resulting DTM will look something like this (values represent word frequencies):

```
[[0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1]
 [0 2 0 1 0 1 1 0 1]
 [1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1]]
```

In this DTM, the words are encoded into unique indices, and the counts represent the frequency of each word in the respective documents. The `feature_names` list contains the words corresponding to these indices.
