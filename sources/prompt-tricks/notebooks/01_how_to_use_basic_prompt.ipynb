        "**Context**: additional information or context that can guide's a model's response\n",

        "\n",
        "**Output Format**: the type or format of the output, for example, JSON, how many lines or paragraph\n",
        "Prompts are associated with roles, and roles inform an LLM who is interacting with it and what the interactive behvior ought to be. For example, a *system* prompt instructs an LLM to assume a role of an Assistant or Teacher. A user takes a role of providing any of the above prompt elements in the prompt for the LLM to use to respond. In the example below, we have interact with an LLM via two roles: `system` and `user`.\n",

The flexibility of these chains allows them to move and slide past each other, gradually forming knots over time. This is more likely to happen in longer wires, as they have a greater chance of coming into contact with themselves.
