## What is logic programming?

Logic programming is a programming paradigm that is based on formal logic and mathematical logic. In logic programming, programs are expressed as a set of logical statements and rules rather than a sequence of imperative statements. It is characterized by the use of declarative statements that describe what should be achieved rather than how to achieve it. The most widely used logic programming language is Prolog.

Key characteristics of logic programming include:

1. **Declarative Syntax:** In logic programming languages like Prolog, you define relationships and facts using a declarative syntax. You specify what you know or want to find out, and the underlying inference engine determines how to compute the results.

2. **Rule-Based:** Logic programming relies heavily on rules and logical inference. Programs are composed of rules that define relationships and facts that provide information.

3. **Pattern Matching:** Logic programming languages use pattern matching to find solutions to queries or goals. The system searches for patterns that match the query and returns results accordingly.

4. **Backtracking:** Backtracking is a key feature of logic programming. If the system encounters a contradiction or cannot find a solution, it can backtrack and explore alternative paths to reach a solution.

5. **Recursive Programming:** Recursion is commonly used in logic programming to define relationships and rules. Recursive rules allow the system to iteratively explore and reason about data.

6. **Inference Engine:** Logic programming languages typically come with an inference engine that uses logical reasoning to derive conclusions from the provided rules and facts.

Applications of Logic Programming:

- **Artificial Intelligence:** Logic programming has been extensively used in AI applications, such as expert systems, natural language processing, and knowledge representation.

- **Knowledge Representation:** Logic programming is well-suited for representing and reasoning about knowledge in a formal and structured manner.

- **Database Query Languages:** Some database query languages, like Datalog, are based on logic programming principles.

- **Proving Theorems:** Logic programming has applications in automated theorem proving and formal verification of software and hardware systems.

- **Semantic Web:** Semantic web technologies, including RDF and OWL, are often used in conjunction with logic programming to represent and reason about semantic information on the web.

- One of the most well-known logic programming languages is Prolog (Programming in Logic), which has been used in a wide range of applications. 
- Logic programming languages provide a powerful tool for solving problems that involve complex relationships and symbolic reasoning.

## logic programming building blocks

1. **Facts:**
   - Facts are the basic units of knowledge in logic programming. They represent assertions or statements that are considered true in a given domain.
   - Facts are typically expressed as predicates, which consist of a predicate symbol followed by a set of arguments enclosed in parentheses.
   - For example, in Prolog:
     ```
     likes(john, pizza).
     color(apple, red).
     ```

2. **Rules:**
   - Rules are used to define relationships or infer new facts based on existing facts.
   - Rules consist of a head and a body. The head specifies the conclusion or the result, while the body contains conditions that must be satisfied for the rule to be applied.
   - For example, in Prolog:
     ```
     is_grandparent(X, Z) :- is_parent(X, Y), is_parent(Y, Z).
     ```

3. **Predicates:**
   - Predicates are symbols that represent relationships or properties in logic programming.
   - Predicates are used in both facts and rules to define and query relationships.
   - Predicates can have zero or more arguments.
   - Examples of predicates: `likes`, `is_grandparent`, `color`.

4. **Variables:**
   - Variables are placeholders that can take on different values.
   - Variables in logic programming are represented with a capital letter or an underscore at the beginning of their names.
   - Variables are used to represent unknown values that need to be determined by the system.
   - Examples of variables: `X`, `Y`, `_`.

5. **Queries:**
   - Queries are questions or goals that you pose to the logic programming system.
   - Queries are typically expressed as predicates with variables.
   - The system searches for solutions that satisfy the query.
   - For example, in Prolog:
     ```
     ?- likes(john, pizza).
     ?- is_grandparent(X, Z).
     ```

6. **Backtracking:**
   - Backtracking is a fundamental mechanism in logic programming.
   - When a query is posed, the system searches for solutions. If it encounters a contradiction or cannot find a solution, it backtracks and explores alternative paths.
   - Backtracking allows the system to explore multiple possible solutions.

7. **Unification:**
   - Unification is the process of matching variables with values or other variables to make logical statements consistent.
   - It's a critical part of how logic programming systems find solutions to queries.
   - Variables can be unified with values or other variables to make the system's rules and facts consistent.

8. **Inference Engine:**
   - The inference engine is the core component of a logic programming system that performs logical reasoning.
   - It uses rules and facts to derive conclusions and find solutions to queries.

## Solving problems using logic programming

Logic programming is a powerful paradigm for solving a wide range of problems, especially those that involve symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and complex relationships.

1. **Define the Problem Domain:**
   - Begin by clearly defining the problem you want to solve. Understand the domain, the entities involved, and the relationships between them.

2. **Model the Problem:**
   - Translate the problem into a logical representation. Identify the facts, rules, and predicates that describe the problem's constraints and requirements.
   - Use predicates to represent relationships and facts to represent known information.

3. **Choose a Logic Programming Language:**
   - Select a logic programming language that best suits your problem domain. Prolog is the most commonly used logic programming language, but other options exist.
   - Familiarize yourself with the syntax and features of the chosen language.

4. **Implement the Knowledge Base:**
   - Create a knowledge base that includes facts and rules based on your problem model.
   - Enter the information you know about the problem domain into the knowledge base.

5. **Formulate Queries:**
   - Pose queries or goals that you want the logic programming system to answer or solve.
   - Queries are expressed as predicates with variables representing unknown values.

6. **Run the Logic Programming System:**
   - Execute the logic programming system with your knowledge base and queries.
   - The system will use its inference engine to search for solutions to the queries.

7. **Interpret Results:**
   - Examine the results returned by the logic programming system. These results may include solutions, answers to queries, or recommendations.
   - Interpret the results in the context of your problem domain.

8. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Logic programming allows for an iterative approach to problem-solving. You can refine your knowledge base, add new facts or rules, and pose additional queries as needed.

9. **Optimize and Fine-Tune:**
   - Depending on the complexity of the problem, you may need to optimize your logic programming code and knowledge base for better performance.
   - Experiment with different strategies and rules to improve the efficiency of your solutions.

10. **Handle Backtracking:**
    - Be prepared to handle situations where the logic programming system encounters contradictions or multiple solutions. Backtracking is a key feature of logic programming, allowing for exploration of alternative paths.

11. **Test and Validate:**
    - Validate the solutions and recommendations provided by the logic programming system against real-world or expected outcomes.
    - Test the system with different scenarios and edge cases to ensure correctness.

12. **Deployment (If Applicable):**
    - If your logic programming solution is intended for real-time or production use, integrate it into the appropriate application or system.

Examples of Problems Solved with Logic Programming:

- **Expert Systems:** Building expert systems for tasks like medical diagnosis, troubleshooting, or decision support.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Parsing and understanding natural language using grammars and rules.
- **Knowledge Representation:** Creating knowledge bases for semantic web applications or knowledge graphs.
- **Puzzle Solving:** Solving puzzles like Sudoku, crosswords, or logic puzzles.
- **Database Querying:** Querying and retrieving information from databases using Datalog.
- **Symbolic Mathematics:** Symbolic algebra systems and automated theorem proving.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Generating recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

## Matching mathematical expressions in logic programming

Matching and manipulating mathematical expressions in logic programming can be achieved using the built-in capabilities of logic programming languages like Prolog. Here, we'll explore how you can perform pattern matching and operations on mathematical expressions in Prolog.

Let's consider a simple example where you want to evaluate basic mathematical expressions represented as Prolog terms. We'll focus on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

1. **Defining Mathematical Expressions:**
   - Define mathematical expressions as Prolog terms. Each term will represent an expression.
   - Use operators to represent addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

```prolog
% Examples of mathematical expressions
expression1(X) :- X = 2 + 3 * 4.
expression2(X) :- X = (5 - 2) / (2 + 1).
expression3(X) :- X = 6 * (2 - 1).
```

2. **Pattern Matching:**
   - Define rules to pattern match and evaluate mathematical expressions.
   - Use recursion to handle nested expressions.

```prolog
% Pattern matching for addition
evaluate(X + Y, Result) :-
    evaluate(X, XResult),
    evaluate(Y, YResult),
    Result is XResult + YResult.

% Pattern matching for subtraction
evaluate(X - Y, Result) :-
    evaluate(X, XResult),
    evaluate(Y, YResult),
    Result is XResult - YResult.

% Pattern matching for multiplication
evaluate(X * Y, Result) :-
    evaluate(X, XResult),
    evaluate(Y, YResult),
    Result is XResult * YResult.

% Pattern matching for division
evaluate(X / Y, Result) :-
    evaluate(X, XResult),
    evaluate(Y, YResult),
    YResult =\= 0,  % Ensure division by zero is avoided
    Result is XResult / YResult.

% Base case: If the expression is a numeric value, return it as is
evaluate(X, X) :- number(X).
```

3. **Querying Expressions:**
   - Pose queries to evaluate mathematical expressions using the `evaluate/2` predicate.

```prolog
?- expression1(Expr), evaluate(Expr, Result).
% Result will contain the evaluated value of the expression.

?- expression2(Expr), evaluate(Expr, Result).
% Result will contain the evaluated value of the expression.
```

With this setup, you can define and evaluate various mathematical expressions in Prolog. The `evaluate/2` predicate uses pattern matching and recursion to traverse the expression tree and compute the final result.

Here are some sample query results:

- `evaluate(2 + 3 * 4, Result)` will yield `Result = 14`.
- `evaluate((5 - 2) / (2 + 1), Result)` will yield `Result = 1`.
- `evaluate(6 * (2 - 1), Result)` will yield `Result = 6`.

**Python code**

To match and manipulate mathematical expressions in logic programming using the `logpy` library in Python, you can create predicates that represent mathematical operations and use them to evaluate expressions. 

Now, let's define predicates for basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and create rules to evaluate expressions:

```python
from logpy import run, var, eq, lall, conde, membero

# Define predicates for basic operations
def add(x, y, z):
    return eq(z, x + y)

def subtract(x, y, z):
    return eq(z, x - y)

def multiply(x, y, z):
    return eq(z, x * y)

def divide(x, y, z):
    return (y != 0) & eq(z, x / y)

# Define a predicate for evaluating an expression
def evaluate_expression(expr, result):
    # Base case: If the expression is a number, the result is the number itself
    yield (eq(expr, result),)

    # Case for addition
    x, y = var(), var()
    yield (lall((add, x, y, expr)), evaluate_expression(x, result), evaluate_expression(y, result))

    # Case for subtraction
    x, y = var(), var()
    yield (lall((subtract, x, y, expr)), evaluate_expression(x, result), evaluate_expression(y, result))

    # Case for multiplication
    x, y = var(), var()
    yield (lall((multiply, x, y, expr)), evaluate_expression(x, result), evaluate_expression(y, result))

    # Case for division
    x, y = var(), var()
    yield (lall((divide, x, y, expr)), evaluate_expression(x, result), evaluate_expression(y, result))

# Create a logic variable for the result
result = var()

# Example: Evaluate the expression "2 + 3 * 4"
expression = 2 + 3 * 4

# Query to find the result of the expression
solutions = run(1, result, evaluate_expression(expression, result))
if solutions:
    print(f"Result of the expression is {solutions[0]}")
else:
    print("No solution found.")
```

In this code:

- We define predicates for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, each with three arguments (x, y, z) that represent the operands and result.

- We define a `evaluate_expression` predicate that recursively evaluates expressions. It handles the base case of a numeric value and recursively handles complex expressions.

- We use logic variables to represent the result of the expression and query for a solution.

- The example evaluates the expression `2 + 3 * 4` and prints the result.

## Validating primes numbers using logic programming

**Using logpy:**

`logpy` is a Python library for logic programming. You can use it to define logic-based rules to validate prime numbers.

Here's a Python code snippet using `logpy` to check if a number is prime:

```python
from logpy import Relation, var, run, eq, conde

# Define a relation to check divisibility
def divisible(x, y):
    return x % y == 0

# Define the prime relation
def prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    return conde([eq(x, 2)], [eq(x, 3)], [divisible(x, 2)], [divisible(x, 3)])

# Create a logic variable
x = var()

# Query to check if a number is prime
result = run(1, x, (prime, x))
print(result)  # Prints True if the number is prime, False otherwise
```

This code defines a `prime` relation and uses `run` to query if a number is prime. It returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

**Using sympy:**

`sympy` is a Python library for symbolic mathematics and can also be used to work with prime numbers.

First, you need to install the `sympy` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

Here's a Python code snippet using `sympy` to check if a number is prime:

```python
from sympy import isprime

# Check if a number is prime
number = 17  # Replace with the number you want to check
is_prime_result = isprime(number)

if is_prime_result:
    print(f"{number} is prime.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not prime.")
```

In this code, we use the `isprime` function from `sympy` to check if a number is prime or not. It returns `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise.

## Parsing a family tree

Creating and parsing a family tree using the `logpy` library in Python involves defining predicates for family relationships and querying the family tree. Let's first create a simple family tree sample and then parse it using `logpy`:

Now, let's define a simple family tree and parse it:

```python
from logpy import run, var, eq, fact, conde

# Define family relationships using facts
father = Relation()
mother = Relation()
grandparent = Relation()

# Define family facts
fact(father, "John", "Bob")
fact(father, "John", "Alice")
fact(mother, "Emily", "Bob")
fact(mother, "Emily", "Alice")
fact(father, "Bob", "Charlie")
fact(mother, "Ella", "Charlie")

# Define rules for grandparent relationships
def find_grandparent(x, z):
    y = var()
    return conde((father(x, y), father(y, z)), (father(x, y), mother(y, z)), (mother(x, y), father(y, z)), (mother(x, y), mother(y, z)))

# Query for grandparents
x = var()
grandparents = run(0, x, find_grandparent(x, "Charlie"))

print("Grandparents of Charlie:")
for gp in grandparents:
    print(gp)
```

In this code:

- We define family relationships using the `Relation` function for `father`, `mother`, and `grandparent`.

- We use the `fact` function to define family facts. For example, "John" is the father of "Bob," and "Emily" is the mother of "Alice."

- We define a `find_grandparent` rule that finds grandparent relationships using a logic variable `y`.

- We use the `run` function to query for the grandparents of "Charlie" using the `find_grandparent` rule.

## Analyzing geography

Analyzing the geography of the United States in terms of coastal states and adjacent states can be done using `logpy` by defining relations that represent the geographical connections between states. Let's create a sample geography dataset with at least 13 relations and then query for coastal states and adjacent states:

Now, let's define a simple geography dataset and perform queries:

```python
from logpy import Relation, facts, run, conde, eq, var

# Define geographical relations
adjacent = Relation()
coastal = Relation()

# Define geographical facts (adjacent states)
facts(adjacent, ("Washington", "Oregon"), ("Washington", "Idaho"),
               ("Oregon", "California"), ("Oregon", "Nevada"),
               ("Idaho", "Montana"), ("California", "Nevada"),
               ("California", "Arizona"), ("Nevada", "Arizona"),
               ("Montana", "North Dakota"), ("Montana", "South Dakota"),
               ("Montana", "Wyoming"), ("Montana", "Idaho"),
               ("North Dakota", "Minnesota"))

# Define coastal states
facts(coastal, "Washington", "Oregon", "California")

# Query for coastal states
x = var()
coastal_states = run(0, x, coastal(x))

print("Coastal States:")
for state in coastal_states:
    print(state)

# Query for adjacent states of Montana
adjacent_states = run(0, x, adjacent("Montana", x))

print("\nAdjacent States of Montana:")
for state in adjacent_states:
    print(state)
```

In this code:

- We define two relations: `adjacent` to represent adjacent states and `coastal` to represent coastal states.

- We use the `facts` function to define adjacent state relationships.

- We use the `facts` function again to define coastal states.

- We query for coastal states using the `coastal` relation and adjacent states of Montana using the `adjacent` relation.

When you run this code, it will print the coastal states of the United States and the adjacent states of Montana based on the defined geographical relations.

You can extend this dataset with more states and relationships as needed to analyze the geography of the United States further.

## Building a puzzle solver

```python
from logpy import Relation, facts, run, eq, var, conde

# Define relations for the puzzle
owns = Relation()
lives_in = Relation()

# Define puzzle facts
facts(owns, ("Steve", "blue car"), ("Jack", "cat"), ("person who owns cat", "Canada"))
facts(lives_in, ("Matthew", "USA"), ("person with black car", "Australia"), ("Alfred", "Australia"), ("person with dog", "France"))

# Create logic variables for the puzzle
x = var()

# Query to find who has a rabbit
rabbit_owner = run(0, x, conde([owns(x, "rabbit")], [lives_in("person who owns cat", x)]))

print("Who has a rabbit?")
print(rabbit_owner[0])
```

In this code:

- We define relations for ownership (`owns`) and living locations (`lives_in`).

- We specify facts about ownership and living locations based on the provided constraints.

- We create a logic variable `x` to query for the person who has a rabbit.

- We use the `run` function with a `conde` goal to find the person who has a rabbit, either directly through ownership or by inferring from their living location.

## another puzzle solver

```python
from logpy import Relation, facts, run, eq, var, conde

# Define relations for the puzzle
owns = Relation()
lives_in = Relation()
has_pet = Relation()

# Define puzzle facts
facts(owns,
      ("Steve", "blue car"),
      ("Jack", "cat"),
      ("Matthew", "dog"),
      ("Alfred", "black car"),
      ("Alice", "rabbit"))

facts(lives_in,
      ("Steve", "Canada"),
      ("Matthew", "USA"),
      ("Alfred", "Australia"),
      ("Jack", "France"),
      ("Alice", "Canada"))

facts(has_pet,
      ("Matthew", "dog"),
      ("Jack", "cat"),
      ("Alice", "rabbit"))

# Create logic variables for the puzzle
x = var()

# Query to find who has a black car
black_car_owner = run(0, x, conde([owns(x, "black car")], [lives_in(x, "Australia")]))

# Query to find who lives in Canada
canadian_residents = run(0, x, lives_in(x, "Canada"))

# Query to find who has a pet
pet_owners = run(0, x, has_pet(x, var()))

print("Who has a black car?")
print(black_car_owner[0])

print("\nWho lives in Canada?")
print(canadian_residents)

print("\nWho has a pet?")
print(pet_owners)
```

In this extended puzzle:

- We added a `has_pet` relation to represent people who have pets.

- We specified additional facts related to car ownership, living locations, and pet ownership based on the given constraints.

- We created logic variables to query for different pieces of information.

- We provided queries to find the owner of a black car, people living in Canada, and people who have pets.
